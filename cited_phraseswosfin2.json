            " Question 6: Outcome of Knowledge  Conversion  We now proceed to Question 6, which asks about the outcome of knowledge conversion, which was not adequately developed in Nonaka (1994).",
            " Discussion and Conclusion Based on the article by Nonaka (1994) in Organization Science, two premises have inﬂuenced more than 15 years of theory building and research on organizational knowledge creation: tacit and explicit knowledge can be conceptually distinguished along a continuum, and knowledge conversion explains, theoretically and empirically, the interaction between tacit and explicit forms of knowledge.",

            " An exception is Nurse (2001, also quoted and reiterated in Gourlay and Nurse 2005), who analyzed Nonaka et al. (1994) and observed that, apart from lack of transparency in the data introducing problems of reliability, this early statistical model did not adequately account for the social context of knowledge conversion.",

            " Third, knowledge is explicit and tacit along a continuum (Nonaka 1991, 1994).",
            " In the theory, tacit and explicit knowledge are not separate but “mutually complementary” in that they dynamically interact with each other in creative activities by individuals and groups (Nonaka 1994, Nonaka et al. 1996a, Alavi and Leidner 2001).",
            " In the theory, “knowledge conversion” captures the interaction between tacit and explicit knowledge along the continuum and refers to two elements (Nonaka 1994): ﬁrst, personal subjective knowledge can be socially justiﬁed and brought together with other’s knowledge so that knowledge keeps expanding (Massey and Montoya-Weiss 2006).",
            " In these processes, tacit and explicit knowledge mutually enhance each other towards increasing the capacity to act4 (Nonaka 1991, 1994; Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995).",
            " Explicit knowledge can be shared at low cost amongst individuals and loses some of its “explicitness” through internalization, where people move to act on the knowledge (Nonaka 1994)."

            "  Both  Teece  et al. (1997) and Nelson and Winter (1982) take an efﬁciency approach to ﬁrm performance rather than  a  privileged  market  position  approach (the latter being the underpinning for Porter’s (1980)  theory  of  competitive  advantage).",
            "  Also  like  Nelson and  Winter  (1982),  Teece  et al.  (1997)  highlight  the  importance  of  path  dependencies, and the need to reconﬁgure a ﬁrm’s resources to enable the ﬁrm to change and evolve.",
            " Speciﬁcally, Bowman and Ambrosini  (2003)  building  on  Teece  et al. (1997) explain that dynamic capabilities comprise  four  main  processes:  reconﬁguration, leveraging,  learning  and  creative  integration.",
            " This comment  is  easily  understood,  as  arguably  the most  inﬂuential  dynamic  capability  articles, those  by  Teece  et al.  (1997)  and  Eisenhardt and  Martin  (2000),  use  illustrative  examples deriving from data that, while pertinent, were not  collected  purposively  to  understand dynamic capabilities.",
            " First, as noted by Newbert  (2007),  it  is  hardly  surprising  that there is little empirical work, as the theoretical work  did  not  start  until  Teece  et al.  (1997).",

            "  External Factors  The majority of the work on dynamic capabilities  and  the  original  work  of  Teece  et al. (1997)  assert  that  dynamic  capabilities  were necessary  to  deal  with  rapidly  changing environments.",
            "  perspective focuses on the capacity an organization facing a rapidly changing environment has to create new resources, to renew or alter its  resource  mix  (Teece  et al.  1997),  and  it acknowledges that ‘the top management team and  its  beliefs  about  organizational  evolution may  play  an  important  role  in  developing dynamic  capabilities’  (Rindova  and  Kotha 2001, 1274).",

            "  ‘Paths’ are about history and acknowledging that history matters, that ‘bygones are rarely bygones’ (Teece et al. 1997, 522) and that the ﬁrm’s  past  and  present  guide  and  constrain its future."

            " This is captured in descriptions of sensemaking as a “process” (Balogun \u0026 Johnson, 2004; Cornelissen, 2012; Gephart et al., 2010; Sonenshein, 2010; Weick, 1995), a “recurring cycle” (Louis, 1980), or something that “unfolds as a sequence” (Weick et al.",
            " Many scholars also see sensemaking as the process through which “people create and maintain an intersubjective world” (Balogun \u0026 Johnson 2004, p. 524), and “produce, negotiate, and sustain a shared sense of meaning” (Gephart et al.",
            " This experience of a discrepancy, or violation, is subjective, and how signiﬁcant it feels will be inﬂuenced by a variety of factors, including its impact on individual, social, or organizational identity (Corley \u0026 Gioia, 2004; Pratt, Rockmann, \u0026 Kaufmann, 2006) and personal or strategic goals (Balogun \u0026 Johnson, 2004; Maitlis, Vogus, \u0026 Lawrence, 2013).",
            " These include environmental jolts (Meyer, 1982; Milliken, 1990) and organizational crises (Brown \u0026 Jones, 2000; Weick, 1988, 1993; Wicks, 2001), threats to organizational identity (Dutton \u0026 Dukerich, 1991; Elsbach \u0026 Kramer, 1996), and planned organizational change initiatives (Balogun \u0026 Johnson, 2004; Gioia \u0026 Chittipeddi, 1991).",
            " Alternatively, change processes may begin with a structural transformation that disturbs existing understandings of the organization and so leads to sensemaking (Balogun \u0026 Johnson, 2004; Mantere et al., 2012).",
            "  Other studies reveal fragmented sensemaking, where the process is dominated by middle managers (Balogun \u0026 Johnson, 2004, 2005) or other organizational members (Walsh \u0026 Bartunek, 2011)."

            " To understand how such ‘‘institutional’’ rationality is diﬀerent from ‘‘instrumental’’ rationality, it is helpful to revisit the classic statement by Meyer and Rowan (1977).",

            "  Institutional sources of practice variation  While the early statement by Meyer and Rowan (1977) signaled the study of both homogeneity and heterogeneity, research on the institutional sources of practice variation has only begun to be developed.",
            "  The emergence of the concept of logic has been a key turning point in redirecting attention back to the kind of institutional rationality suggested by Meyer and Rowan (1977) as well as the study of institutional sources of practice variation.",
            " A more complete revival of the more pluralistic approach to institutional rationality signaled by Meyer and Rowan (1977) requires an approach to logics that conceptualizes institutional environments as more fragmented and contested (Schneiberg, 2007; Schneiberg \u0026 Soule, 2005; Townley, 2002; Washington, 2004).",
            " In fact, within the neoinstitutional canon, we need look no further than Meyer and Rowan (1977) who provided a conceptualization of conformity to institutional pressures that was decoupled from the buzzing confusion of everyday life."

            " Using a practice lens (Brown and Duguid 2001, Orlikowski 2000), we suggest that in settings where work is contextualized and nonroutine, traditional models of coordination are insufﬁcient to explain coordination as it occurs in practice.",
            " One implication is that coordination at the boundary may require reconciliation and transformation of knowledge (Bechky 2003) and, thus, involves the COPs themselves (Brown and Duguid 2001).",
            " Furthermore, knowledge tends to be embedded in localized work practice and difﬁcult to decontextualize (Brown and Duguid 2001, Lave 1988).",
            " This reframing is necessary and timely because of the growing recognition that routine coordination (in the sense of recognizable and repetitive patterns) cannot be speciﬁed in sufﬁcient detail to be carried out and is, thus, insufﬁcient to coordinate complex knowledge work (Brown and Duguid 2001, Feldman and Pentland 2003).",
            " This practice-based rethinking of coordination builds and complements parallel research on the related topics of work practices (Orlikowski 2002), organizational routines (Feldman and Pentland 2003), learning (Lave 1988), and innovation (Brown and Duguid 2001).",
            "  Our ﬁndings about the ways in which COPs play important coordination roles enrich the growing literature on COPs’ role in organizing knowledge work (Brown and Duguid 2001, Orr 1996, Wenger 1998).",
            "  Conclusion Organizational knowledge researchers have suggested that practice is central to understanding work and have called for a deeper understanding of complex organizational work processes (Brown and Duguid 2001, Carlile 2002, Feldman and Pentland 2003, Orlikowski 2002)."
